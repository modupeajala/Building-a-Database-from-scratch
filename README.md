# Introduction
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. 
Arasâ€™ customers are very big companies like Microsoft and GE Aviation. Each of these large corporations have slightly smaller companies within them. The purpose of this project is to find a way to roll up all of these individual companies that belong to a bigger company under that Enterprise company's accounts.
